# NodeJs

- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser

## Run JavaScript using NodeJs.

- Install Node in your system.
- `node file-name.js`

## Importing node module/package.

- To import any module we use `require` keyword.
- `require('fs')` _now fs(FileSystem) module is included in our project_
- `const fs = require('fs')` _including and storing the reference in fs variable_

# How NodeJs Works

- NodeJs is single threaded based on event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
- Perfect for building fast scalable and data intensive application.
  - Data streaming Application
  - Real Time Chat Application
  - Server Side Web Application

**Do Not Use NodeJS For CPU Intensive Application**
